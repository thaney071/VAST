/*******************************************************************************
Cutdown Code with out data loger
Author: Tom Haney
Date: 4 March 2015
Version 2.0
Description:
this code uses timer 1  to keep track of how
long the balloon has been in flight. Using the specified time,
the module will wait, then turn on the nichrome wire and drop the
payload. The module can also recive a interupt on pin 5 that will
trigger the payload drop.
